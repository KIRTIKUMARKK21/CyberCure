==================
Our idea is to create a one-stop solution for most of the cyber security and misinformation related
problems faced by any user. There are various attacks on the user systems that can go unnoticed
and harm the system if not detected early. Most of the tools that are available today are either very
complex to use or available only for enterprises, and of course many of them our paid. Our project
aims to solve that problem (for free!).
Other than that, in this era of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing problem of fake content
such as deepfakes that can be used to extract revenge, propagate hate or create chaos. There are
misinformation campaigns carried out by manipulating the images and making them viral on social
media. Our project aims to help combat this problem as well.
For help in combating the above problems we are going to include the following features in our web
app:
1. Intrusion Detection System: An intrusion detection system is a device or software
application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.
2. Image Forgery Detection: Image forgery means manipulation of the digital image to conceal
some meaningful or useful information of the image.
3. Android malware detection: Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause
disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network.
